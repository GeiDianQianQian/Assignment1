1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find
easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?

In file np_summary.py, I use NumPy to calculate and I use Pandas in pd_summary,py. In
both different files, I do the same calculations. In my opinion, Numpy is easy to read,
but Pandas works easily. Because the Numpy's code looks easily, but the lines of Pandas's
code is shorter.

2. What were the running time of the two pivot_months_*functions?How can you explain the
difference?

For function pivot_months_pandas(data), it has 10 loops and best of 3 is 21.4 ms per loops
For function pivot_months_loops(data), it has 1 loop and best of 3 is 885 ms per loops
pivot_months_pandas has more loops, but it takes shorter time for each loop. pivot_months_loops
has only one loop which means it put all things together in the same function, so the loop
takes long time.
